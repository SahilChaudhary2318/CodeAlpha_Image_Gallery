# CodeAlpha_Image_Gallery

This project is an image gallery that allows users to view thumbnails of supercars and hypercars. Upon clicking a thumbnail, a full-size version of the image is displayed in a modal, with next/previous navigation buttons for easy image browsing.

Features:
Responsive Image Thumbnails: A gallery of car images displayed in a single line.
Full-Screen Modal: Clicking on a thumbnail opens a full-size image in a modal.
Image Navigation: Navigate between images using next/previous buttons and keyboard shortcuts (← and → keys).
Smooth Transitions: Hover effects on thumbnails and smooth transitions between images.
Responsive Design: Adaptable for different screen sizes, with breakpoints for smaller devices.

Technologies Used:
HTML: Structure of the gallery and modals.
CSS: Styling, hover effects, and layout of the gallery.
JavaScript: Modal functionality and image navigation.

Code Snippet:
Go to index.html for basic structure of the Web page. Styles.css for styling and script.js for functionality of the Web page.

How It Works:
The gallery displays image thumbnails horizontally in a flexible layout. Hovering over an image scales it up slightly.
Clicking a thumbnail opens a modal window, displaying the full-size image.
Next and Previous buttons, along with keyboard navigation (← and → keys), allow users to cycle through images.
